# HNU Solar Online Tool. Mode 2
-----------------------
This is Mode 2 of the HNU Solar Online Tool. This mode calculates Delta MRT of different indoor locations at a certain hour.

This tool is developed by Yingdong He and Jing Yuan, at University of California, Berkeley.

The original mathematical model is from the paper of Yingdong He et al. (Yingdong He, Edward Arens, Nianping Li, et al. Modeling solar radiation on a human body indoors by a novel mathematical model. Building and Environment, 2021, 187: 107421).

The method of reading climatic parameters from epw files is from # [epwvis](http://mdahlhausen.github.io/epwvis).

EPW files can be downloaded from [epwmap](http://mostapharoudsari.github.io/epwmap) or the [EnergyPlus weather](https://energyplus.net/weather) website.
